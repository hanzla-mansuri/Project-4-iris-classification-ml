Iris Classification using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to classify the Iris dataset into its respective species categories: Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica. It demonstrates the application of supervised learning algorithms and evaluates their performance using key metrics.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning and statistics:

Features:
Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica)
The dataset contains 150 observations with 50 samples for each species.

Objectives
Explore the Iris dataset and understand feature relationships.
Preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning models.
Implement and compare different machine learning classifiers.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Methodology
Data Exploration:
Statistical analysis and visualization of features.
Identifying patterns and distributions in the dataset.
Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values (if any).
Standardization and normalization of features.
Model Development:
Train and test multiple classifiers, such as:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forests
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search or cross-validation.
Evaluation:
